### XXXC-Restricting Parent volume deletion in presence of clones.

#### Description

The intention of this test is to ensure that the parent volumes are not deletable in presence of its clones.

#### Prerequisites

- Konvoy Cluster should be created and have the dependencies installed.
- cStor based storage pool should have been created.
- OpenEBS storage class should be created with the desired storage pool claim.

#### Procedure

- This job triggers the litmus experiments which checks if OpenEBS admission server blocks the deletion of parent volume when it has descendants.
- The litmus experiment receives the necessary parameters in form of pod environmental variables and updates the manifest files accordingly.
- The next litmus experiment creates snapshot of OpenEBS persistent volume and create clone using the snapshot.
- Then, the job attempts to delete the parent volume which has snapshot and clone.
- OpenEBS admission controller should prevent the deletion by throwing appropriate error message.
- Finally, this job updates the result CR with the actual result.

#### Expected result

- The volume snapshot should be created successfully.
- The clone should be created successfully.
- The parent volume should not be deleted and throw appropriate error message.
